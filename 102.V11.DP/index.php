				<p>Yale University Stephen Roach surprised the financial community when he wrote a story for Bloomberg titled…
				</p>
				<p>“How the Coming Crash in the Dollar Will Unfold.”</p>
				<p>In the article, Roach says, “America’s saving and current-account problems are about to come into play with a vengeance.”</p>
				<p>And Roach is not the only financial expert warning <a href="#"><u style="color: blue;"><b>Americans to pay attention to what’s happening to our currency</b></u></a></p>
				<p>Porter Stansberry, who started one of America’s most successful financial research firm more than 20 years ago, says:</p>
				<p >“Today, every savvy wealthy person I know is desperately seeking a way out of our corrupt and bankrupt global financial system and the U.S. dollar. And it’s fascinating how they’re doing it.”   <a href="https://secure.stansberryinnovationsreport.com/?cid=MKT421756&eid=MKT427110&encryptedSnaid=&snaid=&step=start&affId=1587&s1=102fe315c3364e5a1da6d1ff885229&assetId=AST138671&page=1"> <u style="color: blue;"><b>More here…</b></u></a>
				</p>

				<div class="mt-4 px-3" style="font-size: 18px;">
					<h2 style="font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif; color:#2528a2;">Stansberry adds:</h2>
			<p>“What we’re ultimately looking at here will be the <a href="#"><u style="color: blue;"><b>Biggest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind</b></u></a> — bigger than any political revolution by a huge margin.”

			<p> Stansberry is well known in the investment world for not only identifying many of the decade’s biggest winners (he recommended Amazon at $59 and Paypal before it soared 800%) but also many of the biggest busts, including the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and many others.</p>

			<p>And today Stansberry says a huge currency shift could be underway.</p>

			<p>That’s why Stansberry went on camera for 10 minutes from his corner office <a href="#"><u style="color: blue;"><b>(click here to watch) </b></u></a>to explain the full U.S. dollar story, and the 3 critical steps every American should now take.</p>

			<p>I strongly encourage you to take a few minutes to get the facts for yourself</p>
